Updating user documentation
===========================

If you have made changes to your documentation, you can update version that you had previously added to the documentation server using the following instructions.

1. Regenerate the html files for your documentation project using sphinx.

2. Navigate to ``<server_root>/documentation/users/<documentation_name>/`` on the file system used by the documentation server.

3. Delete the old build folder in this directory.

4. Copy over the new build folder generated from step 1.

Your documentation should now be ready to view on the documentation server.
